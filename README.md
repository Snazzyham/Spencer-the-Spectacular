# Spencer the Spectacular 

Spencer is an iOS app that is based off of a concept for a vending machine that gives you fortunes you may or may not want to hear. He started off as a simple, boring web app with just text, and soon turned into a fully fledged app with a pretty hot design if I may say so myself. 

The designs and images used in this application are the Intellectual Property of Percolate Galactic, the code is free to be repurposed and re-used. 

I used the Ionic Framework to turn this web app into an iOS app, and if you'd like to help beta test it, sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aPTfnd31-B-rC21f4nktq__KBL7W1DsiXLPMh5f_c50/viewform). 

A web app version can be found [here](http://spectacularspencer.com). It should work on most devices, however, you may run into some layout issues depending on screen size.  

Spencer is available on the [App Store](http://appsto.re/us/sLdmab.i) now.
